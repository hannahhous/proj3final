About this assignment:
    This assignment implements an online Gomoku game server using socket programming in C++.
    The server supports multiple users and games with features including user registration/authentication,
    game play, observer functionality, and inter-user communication (direct messages, broadcasts, and game messages).
    The server handles game states including win detection, time limits, and player disconnections throughout runtime.
    All user data, including preferences and stats, is saved to a file to survive server restarts.


Assumptions:
    - The server has permission to read/write files in its directory for user data persistence
    - Users will interact with proper telnet clients
    - Network interruptions lasting longer than the socket timeout will result in connection loss
    - Users can only play or observe one game at a time
    - Usernames are unique and case-sensitive
